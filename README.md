This is a simple Pokedex app which pulls its Pokemon information from a REST API.

When the app is launched, you will see hundreds of different pokemon listed by name. Click on any one of them, or filter by name to see a pop-up modal with the pokemon's sprite and information.

The app was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla and jQuery), and Bootstrap.
