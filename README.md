This is a simple Pokedex app which pulls its Pokemon information from an external API.

When the app is launched, you will see 150 different pokemon listed by name on the lefthand side. Click on any one of them to see a pop-up modal with the pokemon's sprite and information.

The app was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla and jQuery), and Bootstrap. However the majority of the styling is done with JavaScript and Bootstrap.
